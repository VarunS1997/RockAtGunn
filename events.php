                <p>
                    We are students who are committed to listening and talking with other students about anything and everything. We are here to listen and share our experiences. ROCK is a peer advisory group/student support group that is completely student-run. We are also an outreach group that hopes to create connections around campus and build a strong campus community in which all students feel welcomed.

                <p>
                    This group was formed in response to the events that happened at the end of the 08-09 school year. The Gunn community truly came together and we hope to continue that sense of community and let people know that there are a lot of people at Gunn who even though you may not know but are there for you and would like to listen, talk, and help in any way. It is also a way for students to connect with one another.

                    Plus, it always seems less daunting to talk to one of your peers–talking to people who’ve been through the same kinds of situations can really put things into perspective.

                    Anyone can be someone’s rock. That’s the whole point. We just want to spread this concept and encourage communication among students.
